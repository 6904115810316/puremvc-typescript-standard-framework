## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) Standard Framework for [TypeScript](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-typescript-standard-framework/wiki)

These are sources, unit tests and minified library for PureMVC Standard Framework for TypeScript.

## Status
Development - [Version 1.0](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-typescript-standard-framework/blob/master/VERSION)

Considered as «development» while the TypeScript language specification is not finalized.

## Platforms / Technologies
* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [YUI Test](https://github.com/yui/yuitest)
* [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)
* [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

## Usage

As this port depends on the TypeScript language you may want to start by reading [TypeScript getting started guide](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Unit Test can be run live in the browser using included HTML file [test.html](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-typescript-standard-framework/blob/master/test-minified.html)

## Build

To build the project you'll need to download and install :
* [TypeScript compiler](http://www.typescriptlang.org/#Download)
* [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
* [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html/) (Ant specifically need a JDK not a simple JRE, don't forget to change environment var JAVA_HOME to the JDK path).

1. Rename the file [user.properties.sample](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-typescript-standard-framework/blob/master/user.properties.sample) to **user.properties**
2. Edit the file and replace **MY_TYPESCRIPT_COMPILER_PATH** by the real TypeScript compiler full
system path. e.g. on windows: `<code>`typescript.compiler.path = C:/Documents and Settings/{USER NAME HERE}/Application Data/npm/tsc.cmd
3. Use your favorite editor to run Ant or simply type `<code>`ant puremvc-typescript-standard-framework/build
